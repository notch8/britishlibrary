The authors focus on humanities data and its visualisation, through analysis of their own recent projects with museums, archives and libraries internationally. Their account connects the specifics of hands-on digital humanities work to larger epistemological questions. They discuss the sources of potential mistrust, and examine how different expectations and assumptions emerge depending on the use and user of the data; they offer a simple schema through which the implications may be traced. It is argued that vital issues of trust can be engaged with through design, which, rather than being conceived as a cosmetic finish, is seen as contributing insights and questions that affect the whole process. The article concludes with recommendations intended to be useful in both theory and practice.",12/10/2021,,,British Library,Digital Scholarship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Interdisciplinary Science Reviews,,46,,,4,522-546,,Taylor and Francis,UK,,0308-0188,1743-2790,,12/09/2020,,https://doi.org/10.1080/03080188.2021.1872874,,,,,,English,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/,http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/,,10.1080/03080188.2021.1872874,,,,,,,,,scepticism,interrogability,digital humanities,,,,,,

",Naomi,,,0000-0003-2219-1090,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"William Blake (1757-1827) is considered one of the most singular and brilliant talents that England has ever produced. Celebrated now for the originality of his thinking, painting and verse, he shocked contemporaries by rejecting all forms of organized worship even while adhering to the truth of the Bible. But how did he come to equate Christianity with art? How did he use images and paint to express those radical and prophetic ideas about religion which he came in time to believe? And why did he conceive of Christ himself as an artist: in fact, as the artist, par excellence? These are among the questions which Naomi Billingsley explores in her subtle and wide-ranging new study in art, religion and the history of ideas. Suggesting that Blake expresses through his representations of Jesus a truly distinctive theology of art, and offering detailed readings of Blake's paintings and biblical commentary, she argues that her subject thought of Christ as an artist-archetype. Blake's is thus a distinctively 'Romantic' vision of art in which both the artist and his saviour fundamentally change the way that the world is perceived.",2018,,,British Library,Research Development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I.B.

Regular readers will know that our reports reflect the breadth of research undertaken by our staff, students, fellows and collaborators during the previous academic year, in this case October 2019 to September 2020. This was a year of momentous change for many of us. The effects of national lockdowns, travel restrictions and the ability to access and research our physical collections, or collaborate safely in person, presented a great challenge. But it was also an opportunity to rethink how we do research effectively together when apart. And the range of successful projects, international collaborations and fellowships celebrated within these pages are testament to this.",2022,,,British Library,Research Development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,17,,British Library,"London, UK
